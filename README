This is a VS2012 C# project template that creates a solution with several projects to create a simple WCF service hosted in a console application.  There's a test client that uses the ChannelFactory pattern to call an operation on the hosted WCF service.  There's also a couple of test projects to run mocked unit tests (using Moq) and integration tests against the service.  It provides pretty much everything to get going with a WCF service.

To use:

1.  Drop the zip file into your User Project Templates location for C# WCF projects, e.g. Documents\Visual Studio 2012\Templates\Project Templates\Visual C#\WCF.  You may need to create the WCF folder yourself.
2.  Run VS2012 as an administrator.  This is necessary to avoid an AddressAccessDeniedException when starting up the service host.
3.  Click New Project and navigate to the Templates / Visual C# / WCF folder.
4.  Select the Company WCF Solution template and give it a name.
5.  When the solution is open in VS2012, press F5 to run the console host up.  NuGet will get the Moq component automatically.
6.  The service should advertise it's endpoint URL.
7.  In the Solution Explorer, right click on the TestClient project, select Debug / Start new instance.
8.  The test client starts up, makes a call to the service and should show "Hello Susan!".

You now have a working WCF service and client application that calls it.

Enjoy.
